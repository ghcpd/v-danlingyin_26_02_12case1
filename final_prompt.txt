The project's GUIDE.md is essentially empty — just a title and "Coming soon". However, eventBus.ts exports several classes, types, and interfaces with zero documentation coverage.

Please complete the documentation. Before modifying GUIDE.md, back up the original file to GUIDE_backup.md. Also generate an api_reference.json that organizes all public APIs into structured data in the following format:
{
  "module": "",
  "exports": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "type": "class|function|interface|type",
      "description": ""
    }
  ]
}

Additionally, write a review_summary.md describing what documentation issues you found and how you addressed them.

Do not modify the source code — only modify documentation files. After finishing, run npm test, and all tests must pass.
