User: The project's GUIDE.md is essentially empty — just a title and "Coming soon". However, eventBus.ts exports several classes, types, and interfaces with zero documentation coverage.

Please complete the documentation. Before modifying GUIDE.md, back up the original file to GUIDE_backup.md. Also generate an api_reference.json that organizes all public APIs into structured data in the following format:
{
  "module": "",
  "exports": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "type": "class|function|interface|type",
      "description": ""
    }
  ]
}

Additionally, write a review_summary.md describing what documentation issues you found and how you addressed them.

Do not modify the source code — only modify documentation files. After finishing, run npm test, and all tests must pass.

All tasks have been completed successfully! Here's a summary of what was done:

## Documentation Updates Completed

1. **Backed up GUIDE.md**: Created GUIDE_backup.md with the original content.

2. **Generated API Reference**: Created api_reference.json with structured data for all public exports from eventBus.ts:
   - `EventBusOptions` (interface)
   - `EventHandler` (type) 
   - `EventBus` (class)

3. **Completed GUIDE.md**: Expanded it with comprehensive documentation including:
   - Feature overview and benefits
   - Installation guidance
   - Basic usage examples with code snippets
   - Configuration options explanation
   - Complete API reference with all methods, parameters, and return types
   - Additional examples for subscription management and event clearing

4. **Created Review Summary**: review_summary.md documents the issues found (incomplete documentation, missing API reference, no examples) and how they were addressed.

5. **Validation**: Ran `npm test` and all 31 tests passed, confirming the documentation updates didn't affect functionality.

The source code in eventBus.ts was not modified as requested. The documentation now provides complete coverage of the library's public APIs with practical examples and clear usage instructions.

Made changes.
