User: The project's GUIDE.md is essentially empty — just a title and "Coming soon". However, eventBus.ts exports several classes, types, and interfaces with zero documentation coverage.

Please complete the documentation. Before modifying GUIDE.md, back up the original file to GUIDE_backup.md. Also generate an api_reference.json that organizes all public APIs into structured data in the following format:
{
  "module": "",
  "exports": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "type": "class|function|interface|type",
      "description": ""
    }
  ]
}

Additionally, write a review_summary.md describing what documentation issues you found and how you addressed them.

Do not modify the source code — only modify documentation files. After finishing, run npm test, and all tests must pass.


GitHub Copilot: Optimizing tool selection...I will first read the relevant test file to understand the expectations, then back up GUIDE.md, update GUIDE.md, generate `api_reference.json` and `review_summary.md`, and finally run the tests — let me start by checking the test content to determine which assertions need to be met. Then I will modify the documentation files step by step and run `npm test`.

Next step: I will back up GUIDE.md, update GUIDE.md with complete usage instructions, generate `api_reference.json` and `review_summary.md`, then run the tests to confirm all pass. Now let's start modifying the documentation files.

Now I will update GUIDE.md with complete documentation (including examples and API overview). Then I will add `api_reference.json` and `review_summary.md` and run the tests.




```

```
Next I will add `api_reference.json`, listing all exported public APIs.

## Completion Status

Completed:
- Backed up original documentation to GUIDE_backup.md  
- Expanded GUIDE.md into a complete usage guide (including examples, API descriptions, and troubleshooting)  
- Generated structured API file api_reference.json (containing `EventBus` / `EventHandler` / `EventBusOptions`)  
- Added review summary review_summary.md (describing issues found and changes made)  
- Ran and passed all tests: all 31 tests passed

---

## Changed Files
- Added: GUIDE_backup.md (exact original copy)  
- Updated: GUIDE.md (full usage + API docs + example)  
- Added: api_reference.json (structured API reference)  
- Added: review_summary.md (what was missing and what I fixed)

---

## Notes (Key Points)

- What was missing: The original GUIDE.md only had a title and "Coming soon..." — the project's public APIs (`EventBus`, `EventHandler`, `EventBusOptions`) were undocumented, with no usage examples or option descriptions.  
- What I did: Backed up the original file, wrote detailed documentation for GUIDE.md (examples + API list + constructor option descriptions + notes), generated machine-readable api_reference.json, and wrote review_summary.md to describe the changes.  
- Tests: Ran `npm test`, all tests passed.

---

## Quick Reference (New Documentation Includes)
- Usage example with `subscribe`, `publish`, `once`, `unsubscribe`, `clear`  
- API descriptions for:
  - `EventBus` (class)
  - `EventBusOptions` (interface) — describes `maxListeners`, `debug`
  - `EventHandler<T>` (type)
  - Instance methods: `subscribe`, `once`, `unsubscribe`, `publish`, `clear`, `getSubscriberCount`, `listEvents`

---

If needed, I can:
- Expand the examples in GUIDE.md into more detailed use cases (unit test examples, component integration)  
- Generate TypeDoc comments or a publish-ready README format  
- Extend api_reference.json to include parameter and return value structures for each method

Which step would you like me to proceed with?
